HTML.SafeObject
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 3.1.1
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
    Whether or not to permit object tags in documents, with a number of extra
    security features added to prevent script execution. This is similar to
    what websites like MySpace do to object tags. You may also want to
    enable %HTML.SafeEmbed for maximum interoperability with Internet Explorer,
    although embed tags will cause your website to stop validating.
    <strong>Highly experimental.</strong>
